      <h2>Our Journey</h2>
      <p>In an age where games are at risk of being forgotten and growing more complex by the day there will always be a need to enjoy something simple.
        Websites from our childhood are erasing their libraries and leaving their sites barron. 
        Our founder has this to say. 
        "Games back in the day were fun despite how simple they were. No matter how simple they were fun. Let's have a way for people to enjoy these games again" - Zach Childs.
