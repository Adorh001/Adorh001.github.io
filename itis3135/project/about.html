      <h2>About the Game Museum</h2>
      <p>The Game Museum was founded to archive and celebrate the history of video games from the early arcades to the modern console era.</p>
      <p>Our mission is to ensure gaming's legacy remains accessible and cherished.</p>
      <p>Since the loss of Adobe Flash, the lawsuit that the internet archive faces
        and the many companies from our childhood that have faded away.
        It is our duty to preserve history for future generations to come.
