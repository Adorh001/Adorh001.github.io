                <ul>
                    <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast - The text contrasts well with the background, thanks to the dark text
                        on a light background.
                        However, the navigation bar lacks significant visual distinction. The red horizontal lines blend
                        into the blue background, reducing their effectiveness. A more distinct color scheme could
                        enhance the separation between elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>R</strong>epetition - Repetition is evident in the typography across
                        headers and body text, maintaining consistency.
                        However, the design could benefit from more repeated stylistic elements to unify the visual
                        identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>A</strong>lignment - The alignment is clean and centered, giving the page a professional
                        and structured look.</li>
                    <li><strong>P</strong>roximity - The spacing between the header, navigation bar, and body content is
                        adequate.</li>
                </ul>
