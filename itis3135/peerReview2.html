                <h3>Website 1: <a href="https://webpages.charlotte.edu/qli18/itis3135/client-project/index.html">Yilin's
                        Graphic Design Gallery</a></h3>
                <p> This website is simple, shows off the art of the subject quite well, and is well organized. The
                    design is Consistent, has good font and colors and alignment.
                    Overall this is a good page for an art showcase with the only critisism being the color palette
                    being a bit lacking.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>C</strong>ontrast - The image has vibrant colors that draw attention and complements the
                        gallery concept.
                        The call-to-action text in the gallery section uses a bold purple font, which helps
                        differentiate it from the rest of the page.</li>
                    <li><strong>R</strong>epetition - The consistent purple theme across the page creates a unified
                        brand identity.
                        Repetition in the font style (e.g., the use of clean sans-serif fonts) maintains cohesion.</li>
                    <li><strong>A</strong>lignment - Central alignment of elements like the title, gallery title, and
                        image creates an aesthetically balanced layout.</li>
                    <li><strong>P</strong>roximity - The grouping of the gallery title and description near the image
                        conveys a clear relationship between text and visuals.</li>
                </ul>
