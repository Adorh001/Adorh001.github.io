            <p>What is 3D Modelling?
                3D modelling is the process of creating three-dimensional representations of an object or surface.
                This is normally accomplished through a computer based modelling software like Blender, Autodesk Maya,
                3DS Max, and many others.
                It is a means of recreating our world on the computer and can be a means of art.
                I personally use it for game development but there are other uses like cosplay, building tools, even
                construction.

        <section id="who">
            <h2>Who</h2>
            <p>My name is Adjartey. I am 26 years old, I am from West Africa and I am a massive gamer.
                Ever since elementary school I have been obsessed with making video games and I
                even made games using the Cartoon Network game maker and had multiple levels submitted within
                those systems before the shutdown. At the start I thought I would work on programming. Then at CPCC I
                learned
                that I had more fun working in Maya and creating models. It has been almost six years since I started
                working in 3D
                and I have only been working in Blender for about two to three of those years,
                and I plan to keep working at this for as long as I can still move.

        <section id="when">
            <h2>When</h2>
            <p>Best times to work on modelling is anytime that you feel like you can sit down for an hour or more and
                work without caring what time it is.
                For me the best time is around sunset when the lights come through the blinds and I can sit down with a
                cup of tea, turn on my music, and work.
            </p>

        <section id="where">
            <h2>Where</h2>
            <p>The best place to model is honestly where you feel most comfortable. I prefer to work in my room because
                it feels proper.
                If not my room then someplace quiet or around people who I can be calm around.

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How</h2>
            <p>Once you find what you want to make you will have to find several references and go through trial and
                error at first until you get it down.
                You choose a program based on what you need, maya for modelling and animation, 3DS Max for construction,
                or Blender for just a jack of all trades.
                After that you just create, normally starting with a cube.

        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>Well, it is calming, it is fun, it is just something that I can use to get out what I see in my head.
                Modelling is something that I use to destress most days and to tell stories other days.
                It is something that I can use to create things that I like, for instance creating swords from shows
                that I love.
